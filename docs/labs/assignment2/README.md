## Overview

In Assignment #2 you will put into practice everything that you learn about ROS in Assignment #1, and explore the capabilities of the framework further.

You will attend a 2-hour lab session per week in Diamond Computer Room 5 for the full 12-week semester. You will work **in teams** to develop ROS Nodes for our TurtleBot3 Waffles that allow them to successfully complete a series of robotics tasks, most of which in a *real-world environment*. There are **XXX tasks** to complete in total, all of which will be assessed as part of Assignment #2.
