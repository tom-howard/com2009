title: "Task 4: Documentation"  
---  

## Summary

For this task you will write some documentation to describe the application that you have developed **[for Task 3](./task3.md)**.

Your documentation should be contained within a single `README.md` file which must sit in the root of your team's package directory, i.e.: 

``` { .txt .no-copy }
com2009_teamXX_2025/README.md
``` 

!!! warning "Important"
    Your documentation file **MUST** be called `README.md`, it **MUST** be in the root of your package directory, and it must be created with *Markdown Formatted Text* ([see below](#formatting)).

## Content of your README

Your documentation should contain the following information.

### Overview

A brief explanation of what your application does (no more than 100 words).

### Installation and Execution

Explain (to someone who may not already be familiar) how to install and execute your package on one of the Robotics Laptops in the lab.

In your documentation you can assume that [Steps 1-4 of the Robot/Laptop Setup process](../../../waffles/launching-ros.md) have already been carried out, so **you don't need to discuss any of this**.

This section should also provide details on all the external packages that your application depends upon in order to function (i.e. any libraries that you are using that exist outside your own package). 

### Functional Description

Explain how your application works. This will form the bulk of the documentation, and should include a *Functional Block Diagram (FBD)* to aid the explanation and illustrate the control logic. The FBD should be more than simply a ROS node/topic graph. 

[See here for information on how to include images in your README.md](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#images){target="_blank"} to ensure that they are rendered correctly (see the information on using *relative links* to images that exist within your repository).

### Contributors

List all contributing team members and provide links to their GitHub profiles.

## Word Count

Your documentation should be **600-800 words** in length, any content after the 800-word limit won't be read (and therefore won't be considered in the assessment either).

## Formatting

Your `README.md` file should be formatted using *GitHub Flavoured Markdown*. You can find the [basic formatting syntax here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax){target="_blank"}, which should be sufficient for the purposes of this task. If you really want to do more however, then [the full GitHub Flavoured Markdown Specification can be found here](https://github.github.com/gfm/){target="_blank"}.

When marking this task we will view your `README.md` file on GitHub, so it's important that you check the formatting yourself prior to the Part B deadline. **You will lose marks for formatting errors**!

## Marking 

There are **20 marks** available for this task in total, distributed as follows.

<center>

| Criteria | Marks | Details |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **A**: Overview | 5/20 | A clear and concise summary of the application, and a full and correct explanation of how to install and execute it. |
| **B**: Functional Description | 10/20 | A detailed and accurate description of how the application works (or *was intended to work[^task3-perfomance]*). A clear yet detailed Functional Block Diagram should be included to support the discussion. |
| **C**: Formatting and Writing Standard | 5/20 | Clear, concise and professional writing throughout, which uses technical language appropriately but which is accessible to a none experienced reader. The `README.md` file must be correctly formatted, i.e. headings, styling, code blocks, other text formatting, figures etc. should all be rendered correctly when viewed directly on GitHub. |

[^task3-perfomance]: The marking of this task is *not dependent* on your team's performance in Task 3, so even if you score 0/40 marks in Task 3, you could still score 20/20 marks for this task if you document your work well.
