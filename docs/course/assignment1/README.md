title: "Assignment #1: An Introduction to ROS"
--- 

## Overview

Assignment #1 is an X-part course, which you should complete **in full** and **in order**. The course is designed to be completed in simulation, so you will therefore need access to a ROS installation which can either be installed on your own machine, or accessed on a range of managed computers across the University of Sheffield campus. [See here for more information on how to install ROS (TODO)]().

Each part of the course comprises a series of step-by-step instructions and exercises to teach you how ROS works, and introduces you to the core principles of the framework. The exercises give you the opportunity to see how to apply these principles to practical robotic applications. Completing this course is **essential** for obtaining all the necessary skills for [Assignment #2: the *Team Robotics Project*](../assignment2/README.md), where you will work in teams to program [our real TurtleBot3 Waffle robots (TODO)]().  

## The Course

* [Part 1: Getting Started with ROS2](./part1.md)

    *In this first part you will learn the basics of ROS and become familiar with some key tools and principles of this framework, allowing you to program robots and work with ROS applications effectively.*

* [Part 2: Odometry & Navigation](./part2.md)

    *In this session you'll learn about Odometry data, which informs us of a robot's position in an environment. You'll also learn how to control a ROS robot's velocity (and thus its position) using both open and closed-loop control methods.*

* Part 3: SLAM & Autonomous Navigation

    *Here you'll take your first look at the LiDAR sensor, the data that it generates, and how this can be of huge benefit for robotics applications. You'll see this in practice by leveraging the mapping and autonomous navigation tools within ROS.*

* Part 4: ROS Services

    *In this part of the course you'll learn about ROS Services, which offer an alternative way for nodes to communicate in ROS. You will see how this framework can be used to control a robot or invoke certain behaviours more effectively for certain tasks.*

* Part 5: ROS Actions

    *Building on what you learnt about ROS Services in Part 4, here you will look at ROS Actions, which are similar to Services, but with a few key differences.*

* Part 6: Cameras, Machine Vision & OpenCV

    *Here you'll learn how to work with images from an on-board camera. You will look at techniques to detect features within these images, and use this to inform robot decision-making.*

## Assessment

This assignment is worth 25% of the overall mark for COM2009, and is assessed via an on-campus Blackboard-based test taking place in week 7 or 8 of the Spring Semester.
