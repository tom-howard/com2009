# About this Site

This is the home of The ROS2 Course Assignments for **COM2009**: a second-year undergraduate module for [The School of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/cs). 

This course is designed to teach students how to use ROS2 (The Robot Operating System, Version 2) with TurtleBot3 Waffle robots, using a mix of simulation-based learning and real robot hardware. Most of the initial learning is done in simulation, after which students are able to apply their new-found ROS knowledge to our [real TurtleBot3 Waffle Robots](./robots.md).

The materials here are developed by [Dr Tom Howard](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond-engineering/our-staff/tom-howard), a University Teacher in the [Multidisciplinary Engineering Education Team](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond-engineering/about-us) in **The Diamond**.

These resources are *also* used to teach masters-level Mechatronic and Robotic Engineering students in [The School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/eee) (**ACS6121**).
