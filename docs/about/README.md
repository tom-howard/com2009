# Welcome

This is the home of the COM2009 (& 3009) ROS lab course: a practical course designed for the **"COM2009-3009 Robotics"** module, a second-year undergraduate module for Computer Science students in [the Department of Computer Science](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs) at The University of Sheffield. The lab course is developed by [Dr Tom Howard](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond-engineering/our-staff/tom-howard), a University Teacher in the [Department of Multidisciplinary Engineering Education](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/engineering/diamond-engineering/about-us).

The course here is designed to teach students how to use **ROS (the Robot Operating System)** to program robots, using a mix of simulation-based learning and real robot hardware. Most of the initial learning is done in simulation, and we've got [a WSL-based simulation environment that we use for this](../software/wsl-ros/README.md). Everything that is taught in simulation is applicable to real robots too, and - through this course - students are able to apply their new-found ROS knowledge to our [real TurtleBot3 Waffle Robots](./robots.md) in The Diamond.

## Other Courses

This site is now also used to support the teaching of labs for an [AMRC Training Centre](https://amrctraining.co.uk/) module (**AMR31001**), and the course has also been adapted for a masters-level module for the department of [Automatic Control and Systems Engineering](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/acse) (**ACS6121**).
