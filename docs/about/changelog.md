## Iteration 1

**Academic Year**: 2024-25 

* This course [used to live here](https://tom-howard.github.io/ros/), and was based on ROS 1 Noetic. This year, we've upgraded everything to ROS 2, re-written the courses and moved everything over to this new site. [See the previous version history here](https://tom-howard.github.io/ros/about/changelog/).
* Other notable changes:
    * COM2009 Assignment #2 now only involves three programming tasks (where previously it was four), with an additional assessment on documentation now included instead.
