# Other Installation Options

[WSL-ROS2](../wsl-ros/README.md) is our recommended way to access a ROS2 environment for this course, but if you have a **Mac** or **Linux** machine, *or* if you want to try an alternative option on **Windows**, then you can find further details here.

* [docker-ros2](./docker-ros2.md) (Linux, Mac, Windows)
* [UTM](./utm.md) (Mac)

!!! note
    These options aren't (currently) well tested, so we can't guarantee their success...
