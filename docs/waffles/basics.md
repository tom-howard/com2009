# Waffle (& ROS) Basics

Having completed the steps on [the previous page](./launching-ros.md), your robot and laptop should now be paired, and ROS should be up and running (on the robot). You're ready to bring the robot to life! 

On this page are a series of exercises for you to work through **in your teams**, to explore how the robots work. We'll also talk through some core ROS concepts and use some key ROS tools, in case you haven't had a chance to explore these in simulation yet.

## Manual Control

#### :material-pen: Exercise 1: Making the Robot Move {#exMove}

There's a very useful ready-made ROS application called `teleop_keyboard` (from the `turtlebot3_teleop` package) that we will use to drive a Waffle around. This node works in exactly the same way in both simulation and in the real-world!

1. Open up a new terminal instance on the laptop either by using the ++ctrl+alt+t++ keyboard shortcut, or by clicking the Terminal App icon, we'll refer to this as **TERMINAL 1**. In this terminal enter the following `ros2 run` command to launch the `teleop_keyboard` node:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    ros2 run turtlebot3_teleop teleop_keyboard
    ```
    ***

1. Follow the instructions provided in the terminal to drive the robot around using specific buttons on the keyboard:

    <figure markdown>
      ![](../images/cli/teleop_keymap.svg)
    </figure>

    !!! warning 
        Take care to avoid any obstacles or other people in the lab as you do this!

2. Once you've spent a bit of time on this, close the application down by entering ++ctrl+c++ in **TERMINAL 1**.

## Packages and Nodes

ROS applications are organised into *packages*. Packages are basically folders containing scripts, configurations and launch files (ways to launch those scripts and configurations).  

*Scripts* tell the robot what to do and how to act. In ROS, these scripts are called *nodes*. *ROS Nodes* are executable programs that perform specific robot tasks and operations. These are typically written in C++ or Python, but it's possible to write ROS Nodes using other programming languages too.

There are two key ways to launch ROS applications:

1. `ros2 launch`
1. `ros2 run`

Recall that we just used the `ros2 run` command in Exercise 1 to launch the `teleop_keyboard` node. This command has the following structure:

``` { .bash .no-copy }
ros2 run {[1] Package name} {[2] Node name}
```    

**Part [1]** specifies the name of the *ROS package* containing the functionality that we want to execute. **Part [2]** is used to specify a *single* script within that package that we want to execute. We therefore use `ros2 run` commands to launch **single** executables (aka *Nodes*) onto the ROS network (in Exercise 1 for example, we launched the `teleop_keyboard` node).

The `ros2 launch` command has a *similar* structure:

``` { .bash .no-copy }
ros2 launch {[1] Package name} {[2] Launch file}
```

Here, **Part [1]** is the same as the `ros2 run` command, but **Part [2]** is slightly different: `{[2] Launch file}`. In this case, **Part [2]** is a file within that package that specifies any number of Nodes that we want to launch onto the ROS network. We can therefore launch *multiple* nodes at the same time from a single launch file.

## Sensors & Visualisation Tools

Our Waffles have some pretty sophisticated sensors on them, allowing them to "see" the world around them. Let's now see what our robot sees, using some handy ROS tools.

#### :material-pen: Exercise 2: Seeing the Sensors in Action {#exViz}

1. There shouldn't be anything running in **TERMINAL 1** now, after you closed down the `teleop_keyboard` node (using ++ctrl+c++) at the end of the previous exercise. Return to this terminal and enter the following command:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    ros2 launch tuos_tb3_tools rviz.launch.py
    ```
    ***
    
    This will launch an application called *RViz*, which is a handy tool that allows us to *visualise* the data from all the sensors on-board our robots. When RViz opens, you should see something similar to the following:

    <figure markdown>
      ![](../images/waffle/rviz.png){width=600px}
    </figure>

    In the bottom left-hand corner of the RViz screen there should be a Camera panel, displaying a live image feed from the robot's camera.
    
    ??? bug "No camera images?"

        1. In the top-left "Displays" panel, scroll down to the "Camera" item.
        1. Under "Topic", find the "Reliability Policy" option.
        1. From the Drop-down box, change this from "Best Effort" to "Reliable".

        <figure markdown>
          ![](../images/waffle/rviz_cam_relpol.svg){width=400px}
        </figure> 
    
    In the main RViz panel you should see a digital render of the robot, surrounded by lots of green dots. This is a representation of the *laser displacement data* coming from the LiDAR sensor (the black device on the top of the robot). The LiDAR sensor spins continuously, sending out laser pulses into the environment as it does so. When a pulse hits an object it is reflected back to the sensor, and the time it takes for this to happen is used to calculate how far away the object is.
    
    The LiDAR sensor spins and performs this process continuously, so a full 360&deg; scan of the environment can be generated. This data is therefore really useful for things like *obstacle avoidance* and *mapping*. <!-- We'll explore this in more detail later. -->

1. Place your hand in front of the robot and see if the position of the green dots change to match your hand's location. Move your hand up and down and consider at what height the LiDAR sensor is able to detect it.

1. Then, move your hand closer and further away and watch how the green dots move to match this. 

1. Open up a new terminal instance (**TERMINAL 2**) and launch the `teleop_keyboard` node as you did in Exercise 1. Watch how the data in the RViz screen changes as you drive the robot around a bit.

#### :material-pen: Exercise 3: Visualising the ROS Network {#exNet}

Using `ros2 run` and `ros2 launch`, as we have done so far, it's easy to end up with a lot of different processes or *ROS Nodes* running on the network, some of which we will interact with, but others may just be running in the background. It is often useful to know exactly what *is* running on the ROS network, and there are a few ways to do this.

1. Open up a new terminal instance now (**TERMINAL 3**) and from here use the `ros2 node` command to *list* the nodes that are currently running:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 3:**
    ```bash
    ros2 node list
    ```
    ***

    You may notice up to 4 items in the list.

2. We can visualise the connections between the active nodes by using a ROS node called `rqt_graph`. Launch this as follows:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 3:**
    ```bash
    rqt
    ```
    ***

    A window should then open:

    <figure markdown>
      ![](../images/rqt/main.png){width=600}
    </figure>

1. From here, we then want to load the *Node Graph* plugin. From the top menu select `Plugins` > `Introspection` > `Node Graph`.

1. In the window that opens, select `Nodes/Topics (active)` from the dropdown menu in the top left. 

    What you should then see is a map of all the nodes in the list from above (as ovals), and arrows to illustrate the flow of information between them. This is a visual representation of the ROS network!
    
    Items that have a rectangular border are *ROS Topics*. ROS Topics are essentially communication channels, and ROS Nodes can read (*subscribe*) or write (*publish*) to these topics to access sensor data, pass information around the network and make things happen.

    If the `teleop_keyboard` Node is still active (in **TERMINAL 2**) then this graph should show us that the node is publishing messages to a topic called `/cmd_vel`, which in turn is being subscribed to by the `zenoh_bridge_ros2dds` Node. The Zenoh Bridge node handles all communication between the robot and the laptop, so this node is tunnelling the data from `/cmd_vel` to the robot to make it move.

A ROS Robot could have hundreds of individual nodes running simultaneously to carry out all its necessary operations and actions. Each node runs independently, but uses *ROS communication methods* to communicate and share data with the other nodes on the ROS Network.

## Publishers and Subscribers: A *ROS Communication Method* 

ROS Topics are key to making things happen on a robot. Nodes can publish (*write*) and/or subscribe to (*read*) ROS Topics in order to share data around the ROS network. Data is published to topics via *message interfaces*.

Let's have a look at this in a bit more detail...

#### :material-pen: Exercise 4: Exploring ROS Topics and Interfaces {#exTopicMsg}

Much like the `ros2 node list` command, we can use `ros2 topic list` to list all the *topics* that are currently active on the ROS network.

1. Close down the RQT Graph window if you haven't done so already. This will release **TERMINAL 3** so that we can enter commands in it again. Return to this terminal window and enter the following:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 3:**
    ```bash
    ros2 topic list
    ```
    ***

    A much larger list of items should be printed to the terminal now. See if you can spot the `/cmd_vel` item in the list.
    
    This topic is used to control the velocity of the robot (*'command velocity'*).

1. Let's find out more about this using the `ros2 topic info` command.

    ***
    **TERMINAL 3:**
    ```bash
    ros2 topic info /cmd_vel
    ```
    ***

    This should provide an output similar to the following: 
    
    ``` { .txt .no-copy }
    Type: geometry_msgs/msg/Twist
    Publisher count: 1
    Subscription count: 1
    ```

    This tells us that the *type* of data being communicated on the `/cmd_vel` topic is called: `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`. 
    
    The interface description has three parts:

    1. `geometry_msgs`: The name of the ROS package that this interface belongs to.
    1. `msg`: The type of interface. In this case *message*, but there are other types too. 
    1. `Twist`: The name of the message interface. 

    We have just learnt then, that if we want to make the robot move we need to publish `Twist` *messages* to the `/cmd_vel` topic. 

1. We can use the `ros2 interface` command to find out more about the `Twist` message:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 3:**
    ```bash
    ros2 interface show geometry_msgs/msg/Twist
    ```
    ***

    From this, we should obtain the following:

    ``` { .txt .no-copy }
    Vector3  linear
            float64 x
            float64 y
            float64 z
    Vector3  angular
            float64 x
            float64 y
            float64 z
    ```

    Let's find out what it all means...

## Velocity Control

The motion of any mobile robot can be defined in terms of its three *principal axes*: `X`, `Y` and `Z`. In the context of our TurtleBot3 Waffle, these axes (and the motion about them) are defined as follows:

<figure markdown>
  ![](../images/waffle/principal_axes.svg){width=600}
</figure>

In theory then, a robot can move *linearly* or *angularly* about any of these three axes, as shown by the arrows in the figure. That's six *Degrees of Freedom* (DOFs) in total, achieved based on a robot's design and the actuators it is equipped with. Take a look back at the `ros2 interface show` output above. Hopefully it's a bit clearer now that these topic messages are formatted to give a ROS Programmer the ability to *ask* a robot to move in any one of its six DOFs. 

``` { .txt .no-copy }
Vector3  linear
        float64 x  <-- Forwards (or Backwards)
        float64 y  <-- Left (or Right)
        float64 z  <-- Up (or Down)
Vector3  angular
        float64 x  <-- "Roll"
        float64 y  <-- "Pitch"
        float64 z  <-- "Yaw"
```

Our TurtleBot3 robot only has two motors, so it doesn't actually have six DOFs! The two motors can be controlled independently, which gives it what is called a *"differential drive"* configuration, but this still only allows it to move with **two degrees of freedom** in total, as illustrated below.

<figure markdown>
  ![](../images/waffle/velocities.svg){width=600}
</figure>

It can therefore only move **linearly** in the **x-axis** (*Forwards/Backwards*) and **angularly** in the **z-axis** (*Yaw*). 

#### :material-pen: Exercise 5: Creating A Velocity Control Node (with Python) {#exSimpleVelCtrl}

!!! important
    Before you start this, close down RViz (click the "Close without saving" button, if asked) and stop the `teleop_keyboard` node by entering ++ctrl+c++ in **TERMINAL 2**.

As we've seen, making a robot move with ROS is simply a case of publishing the right ROS Interface (`geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`) to the right ROS Topic (`/cmd_vel`). Earlier we used the `teleop_keyboard` node to drive the robot around, a bit like a remote control car. In the background here all that was really happening was that the node was converting our keyboard button presses into velocity commands and publishing these to the `/cmd_vel` topic.

In reality, robots need to be able to navigate complex environments autonomously, which is quite a difficult task, and requires us to build bespoke applications. We can build these applications using Python, and we'll look at the core concepts behind this now by building a simple node that will allow us to make our robot a bit more "autonomous". What we will do here forms the basis of the more complex applications that you will learn about in the lab course!

1. Above we talked about how ROS Nodes should be contained within packages, so let's create one now using a helper script that we've already put together. (This is covered in more detail in the ROS course, but for the purposes of this exercise let's just go ahead and run the script without worrying too much about it!)

    In **TERMINAL 1**, navigate to the `tuos_ros` Course Repo, which is located in the ROS2 Workspace on the laptop:

    ***
    ```bash
    cd ~/ros2_ws/src/tuos_ros/
    ```
    
    Here you'll find the `create_pkg.sh` helper script. Run this now using the following command to create a new ROS package called `waffle_demo`:

    ```bash
    ./create_pkg.sh waffle_demo
    ```
    ***

1. Navigate into this new package directory (using `cd`):

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    cd ../waffle_demo/scripts/ 
    ```
    !!! info
        `..` means "go back one directory," so that command above is telling `cd` to navigate out of the `tuos_ros` directory (and therefore back to `~/ros2_ws/src/`), and then go *into* the `waffle_demo` package directory from there (and then into the `scripts` directory within that).

    ***

1. Here, create a Python file called `square.py` using the `touch` command:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    touch square.py
    ```
    ***

1. You'll need to change the *execution permissions* for this file in order to be able to run it later on. This is also covered in more depth in the ROS course but, for now, simply run the following command:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    chmod +x square.py
    ```
    ***

1. Now we need to start editing files in our package, and we'll do that using *Visual Studio Code* (VS Code). 

    First, use `cd` to navigate back one directory, to get us back to the root of our package:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:** 
    ```bash
    cd ..
    ```

    Verify that you're in the right place by using the `pwd` command, which should provide the following output:

    ``` { .bash .no-copy }
    $ pwd
    /home/student/ros2_ws/src/waffle_demo
    ```

    Having confirmed that you're in the right place, open up VS Code in this directory:
    
    ```bash
    code .
    ```

    !!! note
        Don't forget to include the `.` at the end there, it's important!!

    ***

1. Next, we need to add our `square.py` file as an executable to our package's `CMakeLists.txt`. 
    
    In VS Code, open the `CMakeLists.txt` file that is at the root of the `waffle_demo` package directory (`/home/student/ros2_ws/src/waffle_demo/CMakeLists.txt`). 
    
    Locate the lines (near the bottom of the file) that read:

    ``` {.txt .no-copy }
    # Install Python executables
    install(PROGRAMS
      scripts/minimal_node.py
      DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME}
    )
    ```

    Replace `minimal_node.py` with `square.py` to define this as an executable of your package:

    ``` {.txt .no-copy }
    # Install Python executables
    install(PROGRAMS
      scripts/square.py
      DESTINATION lib/${PROJECT_NAME}
    )
    ```

1. Next, in the VS Code file explorer, open up the `scripts` directory and click on the `square.py` file to open it up in the editor.

1. Paste the following content into the `square.py` file: <a name="timedSquareCode"></a>

    ```py title="square.py"
    --8<-- "code_templates/timed_square.py"
    ```

    1. `rclpy` is the ROS client library for Python. We need this (and the `Node` class from it) in order to build and run Python ROS nodes.
    2. We know from earlier that in order to make a robot move we need to publish messages to the `/cmd_vel` topic, and that this topic uses the `geometry_msgs/msg/Twist` interface messages. This is how we import that message into the node, in order to create velocity commands in Python (which we'll get to shortly...)
    3. Here we're importing some mathematical operators that could be useful... 

        | Mathematical Operation | Python Syntax |
        | :---: | :---: |
        | $\sqrt{a+b}$ | `#!python sqrt(a+b)` |
        | $a^{2}+(bc)^{3}$ | `#!python pow(a, 2) + pow(b*c, 3)` |
        | $\pi r^2$ | `#!python pi * pow(r, 2)` |

    4. All the functionality of our Python node is contained within a Class called `Square`.    
    5. When we initialise this class, we provide a name for our node, which is the name that is used to register it on the ROS network. We're calling this one "square".
    6. Here we are setting up a publisher to the `/cmd_vel` topic so that the node can write `Twist` messages to this topic to make the robot move.
    7. We're instantiating a `Twist` message here and calling it `vel` (we'll assign velocity values to this later on). A `Twist` message contains six different components that we can assign values to. Any idea [what these six values might represent](#velocity-control)?  
    8. We want our node to run at a rate of 10 times per second (10 Hz), so we create a timer object here, set the timer period (`timer_period_sec`) and then point the object to a *"callback function"* that is defined later on in the code. This callback function will execute at the rate that we specify with `timer_period_sec`...
    9. What time is it right now? (This will help us to keep track of elapsed time in our main timer callback...)
    10. Here we're defining our timer callback function. Everything here will execute at the rate that we specified earlier, so we can encapsulate our main control code in here and be confident that it will execute repeatedly (and indefinitely) at our desired rate.
    11. Here we're comparing the time *now* to the time the last time we checked, to tell us how much time has elapsed since then (converting from nanoseconds to seconds by multiplying by `1e-9`). We'll use that information to decide what the robot should do...
    12. This variable is used to stop the robot (if necessary), check the time again, and then move into a new state.
    13. In state `1` we set velocities that will make the robot move forwards (linear-X velocity only). If the elapsed time is greater than **2 seconds** however, we move on to state `2`.
    14. In state `2` we set velocities that will make the robot turn on the spot (angular-Z velocity only). In this case, if the elapsed time is greater than **4 seconds**, we move back to state `1`.
    15. Regardless of what happens in the `if` statements above, we *always* publish a velocity command to the `/cmd_vel` topic here (i.e. every time this timer callback executes).
    16. The rest of the code here is *"boilerplate"*: a standard approach that we'll use to instantiate our nodes and execute them. You'll learn about all of this throughout the lab course.
    17. We're defining a class method here that we can call when our node needs to shut down. We're controlling a robot here, so it's important to make sure the robot stops moving when this happens.

    Click on the :material-plus-circle: icons above to expand the code annotations. Read these carefully to ensure that you understand what's going on and how this code works.

1. Having programmed our node and defined it as an executable in our package, we're now ready to build the package so that we can run it. We use a tool called "Colcon" to do this, but this **MUST** be run from the root of the ROS Workspace (i.e.: `~/ros2_ws/`), so let's navigate there now using `cd`:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:** 
    ```bash
    cd ~/ros2_ws/ 
    ```

    Then, use the `colcon build` command to build your package:

    ```bash
    colcon build --packages-select waffle_demo --symlink-install
    ```
    
    And finally, "re-source" the environment:

    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc
    ```
    ***

1. Now, run the code.

    !!! note
        Make sure the robot is on the floor and has enough room to roam around before you do this!
    
    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ``` { .bash .no-copy }
    ros2 run waffle_demo square.py
    ```
    ***
    
    Observe what the robot does. When you've seen enough, enter ++ctrl+c++ in **TERMINAL 1** to stop the node from running, which should also stop the robot from moving.
    
5. Now it's time to **adapt the code**:
    
    The aim here is to make the robot follow a square motion path. What you may have observed when you actually ran the code is that the robot doesn't actually do that! We're using a time-based approach to make the robot switch between two different states continuously:
    
    1. Moving forwards
    2. Turning on the spot
    
    Have a look at the code to work out how much time the robot will currently spend in each state.
    
    We want the robot to follow a **0.5m x 0.5m square** motion path.  In order to properly achieve this you'll need to adjust the timings, or the robot's velocity, or both. Edit the code so that the robot actually follows a **0.5m x 0.5m square motion path**!

## SLAM

Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) is a sophisticated tool that is built into ROS. Using data from the robot's LiDAR sensor, plus knowledge of how far the robot has moved[^odom] a robot is able to create a map of its environment *and* keep track of its location within that environment at the same time. In the exercise that follows you'll see how easy it is to implement SLAM with the Waffle.  

[^odom]: You'll learn much more about "Robot Odometry" in the lab course.

#### :material-pen: Exercise 6: Using SLAM to create a map of the environment {#exSlam}

1. In **TERMINAL 1** enter the following command to launch all the necessary SLAM nodes on the laptop:

    ***
    **TERMINAL 1:**
    ```bash
    ros2 launch turtlebot3_cartographer cartographer.launch.py
    ```
    
    ??? tip
        On the laptop, this command is also available as an alias: `tb3_slam`!

    ***

    This will launch a new RViz instance, showing a top-down view of the environment, and dots of various colours representing the real-time LiDAR data. Rather than a robot *model*, the robot is now represented in the environment as a series of links denoted by 3-dimensional red/green/blue crosses (you can turn these off by unchecking the `TF` option in the left-hand "Displays" menu, if you want to). 
    
    <figure markdown>
        ![](../images/waffle/slam_step0.png){width=600px}
    </figure>

    SLAM will already have begun processing this data to start building a map of the boundaries that are currently visible to the Waffle based on its location in the environment.

1. Return to **TERMINAL 2** and launch the `teleop_keyboard` node. Start to drive the robot around *slowly* and *carefully* to build up a complete map of the area.
    
    !!! tip
        It's best to do this slowly and perform multiple circuits of the area to build up a more accurate map.

      ![](../images/waffle/slam_step2.png){width=500px}
      ![](../images/waffle/slam_step3.png){width=500px}
    </figure>

1. Once you're happy that your robot has built up a good map of its environment, you can save this map using the `map_saver_cli` node from a package called `nav2_map_server`:

    1. First, create a new directory within your ROS package on the laptop. Return to **TERMINAL 3** and navigate to the root of the `waffle_demo` package that you created earlier. We can use the `colcon_cd` tool to do this now:

        ***
        **TERMINAL 3:**
        ```bash
        colcon_cd waffle_demo
        ```
        ***

    1. Create a directory in here called `maps`: 
        
        ***
        **TERMINAL 3:**
        ```bash
        mkdir maps
        ```
        ***

    2. Navigate into this directory:

        ***
        **TERMINAL 3:**
        ```bash
        cd maps/
        ```
        ***

    2. Then, use `ros2 run` to run the `map_saver_cli` node and save a copy of your robot's map:

        ***
        **TERMINAL 3:**
        ``` { .bash .no-copy }
        ros2 run nav2_map_server map_saver_cli -f MAP_NAME
        ```
        
        Replacing `MAP_NAME` with an appropriate name for your map. This will create two files: 
        
        1. a `MAP_NAME.pgm` 
        2. a `MAP_NAME.yaml` file
        
        ...both of which contain data related to the map that you have just created.

        ***

    1. The `.pgm` file can be opened using an application called `eog` on the laptop: 
    
        ***
        **TERMINAL 3:**
        ``` { .bash .no-copy }
        eog MAP_NAME.pgm
        ```
        ***

1. Return to **TERMINAL 1** and close down SLAM by pressing ++ctrl+c++. The process should stop and RViz should close down.

1. Close down the `teleop_keyboard` node in **TERMINAL 2** as well, if that's still running.
