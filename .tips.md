## Bringing a branch back in line with main

[From here](https://medium.com/@elton-martins/to-reset-a-git-branch-to-match-the-main-main-branch-6692c28a36fc).

To reset a Git branch to match the main branch, you can use the `git reset` command, as follows:

1. Make sure you are on the branch you want to reset:

    ```bash
    git checkout YOUR_BRANCH
    ```

1. Update your local branch with changes from the remote branch (main):

    ```bash
    git fetch origin main
    ```

1. Reset the local branch to the most recent commit of the remote branch (main):

    ```bash
    git reset --hard origin/main
    ```

    This `git reset --hard` command will discard all local changes in your branch and set the branch to the same commit as the remote main branch.

1. Force update the remote branch:

    ```bash
    git push origin YOUR_BRANCH --force
    ```

    **Note**: Using `--force` with `git push` will rewrite the history of the remote branch. This can cause issues if others are collaborating on the same branch. Make sure no one else is working on the branch or communicate with your team before using `--force`.

> It's important to note that these commands will not directly affect the main branch. They focus on changing the branch you are currently working on (in this case, YOUR_BRANCH) to match the current state of the main/main. This will not impact the main branch directly.

For a range of different `git` ops, [this seems like a good resource to look at in more detail](https://dev.to/jimmymcbride/why-i-bash-git-and-why-you-should-too-3752).

## TMUX

launching tmux with a config file (for a four pane window):

```bash
tmux new-session -s SESSION "tmux source-file ~/tmux.conf"
```

- change SESSION name accordingly
- tmux.conf:

```txt
new
neww
splitw -v
splitw -h
select-pane -t 0
splitw -h
select-pane -t 0
set -g mouse
```
